# 1. Safety Instructions

## General Safety

Safety is the highest priority when using any appliance, especially one involving water, heat, and electrical components. The manual emphasizes several key safety rules:

* Read all instructions before using the dishwasher.
* Use the dishwasher only for its intended purpose: washing dishes and kitchenware.
* Do not operate the dishwasher if damaged or malfunctioning.
* Always follow manufacturer-recommended detergent and rinse aid usage.
* Never allow children to play inside, around, or with the dishwasher.
* Do not sit, stand, or lean on the dishwasher door or racks.

Dishwasher detergent is highly alkaline and can be dangerous if ingested. Users must store detergent away from children and avoid contact with skin and eyes.

## Electrical Safety

To avoid electric shock and fire hazards:

* Proper grounding is required.
* Do not modify the power cord or plug.
* Disconnect power before servicing or cleaning.
* Only qualified technicians should perform repairs.

Improper installation or servicing can result in serious injury or appliance damage.

## Risk of Injury and Damage

Users should:

* Load knives and sharp objects with blades downwards.
* Avoid touching heating elements during or after operation.
* Keep the dishwasher door closed when not loading/unloading to prevent tripping hazards.

These precautions reduce injury risks and ensure safe operation.

# 2. What’s New in Your Dishwasher

Modern Whirlpool dishwashers incorporate several advanced technologies designed for efficiency, cleanliness, and durability.

## Advanced Filtration System

Unlike older dishwashers, Whirlpool dishwashers use a filtration system instead of a grinder. This system:

* Improves cleaning efficiency
* Reduces noise
* Saves energy
* Requires periodic cleaning for optimal performance

The filter captures food particles and prevents them from redepositing onto dishes.

## Energy Efficiency

The dishwasher is designed to meet strict energy standards. Features include:

* Reduced water consumption
* Energy-saving wash cycles
* Sensor-based cleaning adjustments

Cycles may take longer than older dishwashers because efficiency standards prioritize reduced water and electricity use.

## Improved Drying Performance

The dishwasher uses rinse aid to improve drying and prevent water spots. Rinse aid helps water sheet off dishes rather than forming droplets.

The manual strongly recommends always using rinse aid for best results. ([Whirlpool][1])
