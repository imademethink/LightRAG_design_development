### Summary of the Battle of Cannae

The **Battle of Cannae**, fought on **2 August 216 BCE**, was a pivotal confrontation during the **Second Punic War** (218–202 BCE), marking a decisive victory for the Carthaginian general **Hannibal Barca** over the Roman Republic. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest tactical feats in military history, demonstrating Hannibal’s innovative use of battlefield strategy to annihilate a numerically superior Roman force.

### Background Context

- The **First Punic War** (264–241 BCE) established Rome as a rising power and diminished Carthage’s dominance in the Mediterranean.
- Carthage, burdened by war reparations, turned to Spain under General **Hamilcar Barca** to rebuild its strength and resources.
- His son, **Hannibal**, succeeded in expanding Carthaginian influence in Spain and vowed never to make peace with Rome.
- The **Ebro Treaty** (226 BCE) set boundaries between Roman and Carthaginian territories in Spain but tensions escalated when Hannibal besieged **Saguntum** (a Roman ally) in 218 BCE, triggering the Second Punic War.

### Hannibal’s Campaign & Roman Response

- Hannibal famously crossed the **Alps** with his army to invade Italy, winning two major engagements: the **Battle of the Trebia** (218 BCE) and the **Battle of Lake Trasimene** (217 BCE).
- Roman dictator **Quintus Fabius Maximus** adopted a cautious “delaying” strategy (*cunctator*), avoiding direct battle and focusing on attrition.
- The Senate opposed Fabius’ tactics, favoring direct confrontation under consuls **Lucius Aemilius Paulus** and **Caius Terentius Varro**.
- Varro, confident and aggressive, pushed for immediate battle against Hannibal near **Cannae**, despite Paulus' reservations.
