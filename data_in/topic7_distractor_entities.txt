John Adams (1735–1826), second President of the United States, was a pivotal Founding Father whose life spanned the American Revolution, the creation of the nation, and its early years.

Born on October 30, 1735, in Braintree (now Quincy), Massachusetts, Adams grew up on a family farm. His father, a farmer and local officeholder, encouraged education. At fifteen, Adams entered Harvard College, graduating in 1755. He briefly taught school before studying law and being admitted to the bar in 1758. He established a successful legal practice in Boston.

In 1764, Adams married Abigail Smith, a minister’s daughter known for intellect and strong opinions. Their fifty-year partnership produced four surviving children: Abigail, John Quincy, Susanna (who died young), Charles, and Thomas. The couple’s correspondence, especially during long separations, remains a rich historical source on politics, family, and society.

Adams entered public life amid rising colonial tensions. In 1770, he defended British soldiers accused in the Boston Massacre, winning acquittals for most and reduced charges for others. His commitment to legal fairness enhanced his reputation despite unpopularity.

As a Massachusetts delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774, Adams emerged as a leading advocate for independence. He nominated George Washington as Continental Army commander and served on ninety committees, including the one drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Though Thomas Jefferson penned the document, Adams vigorously defended it in Congress.

In 1778, Congress sent Adams to France to aid Benjamin Franklin in securing support for the Revolution. He returned briefly in 1779, during which he drafted the Massachusetts state constitution—still in use today as the world’s oldest functioning written constitution. Sent to Europe again, Adams negotiated a vital loan from the Netherlands and opened Dutch trade to America. In 1782–1783, he joined Franklin, John Jay, and Henry Laurens in Paris to negotiate the Treaty of Paris, formally ending the Revolutionary War and recognizing American independence.

Adams served as the first U.S. Minister to Great Britain from 1785 to 1788, facing cool reception but establishing diplomatic relations. He wrote *A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States*, influencing the Constitutional Convention.

Elected vice president in 1789 under George Washington, Adams served two terms (1789–1797). The role frustrated him; he called it “the most insignificant office” ever invented. Excluded from Washington’s inner circle and mocked in the Senate as “His Rotundity” for supporting formal titles, Adams presided over the Senate and cast tie-breaking votes, often favoring strong federal government.

Throughout these years, John and Abigail maintained official households in New York, Philadelphia, and later Washington, D.C. Unlike many Virginians, Adams never owned enslaved people, opposing slavery morally and politically. The household employed free white and African-American workers, though they may have indirectly hired enslaved labor by paying owners for services.

In 1796, Adams won the presidency in a close election against Thomas Jefferson, becoming the second president (1797–1801). His term faced challenges: factionalism within his Federalist Party, led by rival Alexander Hamilton, undermined his cabinet. Adams retained Washington’s secretaries, but they remained loyal to Hamilton and sabotaged Adams’s agenda.

Foreign crisis dominated: the Quasi-War with France (1798–1800) arose from French seizures of American ships. Adams resisted Hamilton’s push for declared war, seeking peace while strengthening defenses through naval expansion. His restraint avoided full conflict. In 1800, the Treaty of Mortefontaine ended hostilities and restored trade.

Domestically, the Alien and Sedition Acts (1798) proved controversial. Aimed at perceived foreign threats and domestic critics, they extended naturalization periods, allowed deportation of “dangerous” aliens, and criminalized false statements against the government. Federalists used them to silence Republican opponents, leading to arrests and convictions. Critics viewed the acts as unconstitutional attacks on free speech; they damaged Adams’s popularity and contributed to his 1800 defeat.

Adams’s single term ended bitterly with Jefferson’s victory in the “Revolution of 1800.” On his last night in office, Adams appointed midnight judges, including John Marshall as Chief Justice, shaping the judiciary long-term.

Retiring to Peacefield in Quincy, Adams spent twenty-five years corresponding extensively, advising on public affairs, and reconciling with Jefferson in a famous letter exchange starting in 1812. Their correspondence explored philosophy, history, and reconciliation. Adams took pride in his son John Quincy’s political rise, culminating in his 1824 presidential election.

On July 4, 1826—the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence—Adams died at ninety. His last words were reportedly “Thomas Jefferson survives,” unaware Jefferson had died hours earlier at Monticello.

Adams’s legacy is complex. A champion of independence and strong government, he helped forge the nation yet struggled with party politics and controversial laws. His avoidance of war with France preserved national stability. His marriage to Abigail set a model for partnership in public life. As an elder statesman, his writings and correspondence enriched American intellectual heritage. The Massachusetts constitution he authored endures, and his family’s continued public service—especially through John Quincy—extended his influence. Adams embodied principled, often stubborn dedication to republican ideals in a turbulent era.
