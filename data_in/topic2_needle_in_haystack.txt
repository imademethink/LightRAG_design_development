### Key Sections and Insights

#### 1. **Purpose and Use of Employee Handbook**
- Employee handbooks are tools for communicating company **philosophies, expectations, policies, and procedures**.
- **Legal review by an attorney is strongly recommended** to ensure compliance and avoid wording that could weaken legal positions.
- Consistent enforcement of handbook policies is critical to avoid **wrongful discharge or discrimination claims**.
- Employees must receive a copy and be encouraged to read and ask questions.
- A well-crafted handbook fosters **trust, fairness, and employee motivation**, while a poorly written one may create suspicion or resentment.

#### 2. **Introductory Statements**
- Sample introductory statements clarify that the handbook:
  - Describes employment expectations and benefits.
  - Is **not a contract** and does not create contractual obligations.
  - Reserves the right for the employer (owner/supervisor) to amend policies with employee notification.

#### 3. **Initial Employment/Probationary Period**
- Typical probationary period: **6 months** from the date of hire.
- Purpose: Evaluate employee performance and mutual fit.
- Employment during probation is **“at-will”**, meaning termination can occur for any reason not illegal or against policy.
- After probation, employees gain protection under Montana's **“good cause”** termination standard per MCA 39-2-901.
- Probation may be extended due to significant absences or if more evaluation time is needed.

#### 4. **Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)**
- Employers commit to a **diverse and discrimination-free workplace**.
- Prohibited discrimination bases include: race, color, national origin, age, disability, marital status, religion, creed, sex, and political beliefs (*public employers only*).
- Reasonable accommodations are made for qualified individuals with disabilities unless undue hardship exists.
- Complaints can be directed to Human Resources, Montana Human Rights Bureau, or the EEOC.

- Pay periods often split mid-month; paydays are typically the 5th and 20th.

#### 6. **Payment of Wages at Termination**
- Final wages must be paid on the next regular payday or within 15 days of separation, whichever is sooner.
- Common types of termination include resignation, discharge, and layoff.
- Exit interviews provide a forum to discuss benefits, return company property, and voice concerns.

#### 7. **Employee Discipline**
- Employers have the right to discipline, suspend, or terminate for **good cause**.

- Disciplinary steps may include verbal warnings, written warnings, suspension, or termination.
