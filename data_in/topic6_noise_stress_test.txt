[BT CABLE TO THE TRIBUNE.] j
London. Jan. 1. 6 a. m.— New Tear opens
with but little change in the situation in South
Africa. I
Lieutenant Churchill. In a telegram to "The
Fort" from Frere, says that a large number of
American citizens are enrolled in the various
Colonial volunteer corps. There are seventy
flve in one corps of four hundred. They
are admirable soldiers, daring and alert,
and are establishing binding friendships with
' the colonists.
"The Post" publishes a letter dispatched by
Lieutenant Churchill from Pretoria while a
prisoner there, in w,hicb he describes the ar
mored train Incident rhat led to his capture. He
mentions a circumstance in connection there
with which recalls the story of the surrender of
Nicholson's Nek. A soldier who was wounded,
in direct disobedience to orders that no sur
render was to be made, took it on himself to
wave his handkerchief. The Boers Immediately
ceased firing, and most of the British soldiers
then halted and gave up their arms and became
prisoners of war.
A German physician living In Cairo sent to a
Leipsic paper an account of a conversation with
General Kitchener prior to his departure for
South Africa. General Kitchener is reported to
nave'sald that the scattered British forces will
be concentrated as soon as possible. No atten
tion will be paid to the cries of the London
press. They would have to learn patience, for
he did not think the republics would be sub
dued within a year.
Private information reached the Cape Town
correspondent of "The News" to the effect that
European officers arrive at Delagoa Bay weekly
and go on to Pretoria-
Bennett Burleigh in sending a dispatch to
"The Telegraph" yesterday reviews the military
situation in Natal, and prophesies that the
Boera will be rolled back as the result of far
the biggest and fiercest battle of the wax.
It Is reported from Ladysmith by way of
Pretoria that the British are destroying their
heavy cannon prior to a final sortie. The Boers
are threatening the railway between Victoria
West and De Aar, but have not succeeded so far
in cutting the communications. L N. F.
BOER OPPORTUNITIES LOST.
THE FAILURE TO FOLLOW UP VICTORIES
AFFORDS SOME COMPORT TO
ENGLAND.
(Copyright; -1000: By The N?w-TfTlt Tribune.]
[BY CABLI TO THE TRIBUNE.] ■-—
London. Jan. 1, 1 a. m.— The New Tear opens
gloomily for England, with a record of miscal
culation and disaster in South Africa, to be
retrieved at great cost of life and treasure, and
with the reputations of generals in the field
and of Ministers at home hanging upon the
Issue of battle during the next few weeks. There
Is no lack of criticism and fault finding in the
press, and there are signs of anxiety in Minis
terial circles over the political effects of addi
tional reverses to British arms, but there is also
a hopeful feeling induced by fresh proofs of the
Incapacity of the Dutch allies to make use of
their opportunities. The Boer victories of
Stormberg. Magersfontein and Colenso have not
been followed up in any instance. There have
been no successful raids on the lines of com
munication, and Ladysmith, Kimberley and
Mafeking have not been overwhelmed by su
perior numbers and guns. There is a record of
Boer failures as well as British defeats.
The budget of news received at midnight was
a light one. The arrival of a Cape steamer has
r.ro'ught a large mail, and all the morning Jour
nal^ print letters from their special correspond
ents. The most Interesting letters are those
published in "The Standard," "The Times" and
other Journals from Ladysmith, in which inci
dents of tha siege and garrison life are de
scribed. The writers are wisely reticent on im
portant points, and deal lightly with the dan
gers of the equation, but there is little doubt
that the garri. on has been short of ammunition
and that knowledge of this fact has in
fluenced General Buller In sacrUcing his orig
inal plan of campaign and massing his forces
for the relief of Ladysmith. He is still calling
in reinforcements, for the Majestic has gone to
Durban with another battalion and numerous
drafts. No additional battalions of infantry
will be available from incoming transports for
a week.
THE SITUATION AT THE FRONT.
Indications still point to a battle at the end
of this week, although there may be delays
through a muie transport service which General
Buller is evidently organizing on a large scale.
The Tugpla is reported in flood from the heavy
rains, and the passage of the river will be nost
difficult.
News from the western border Is neagre.
There are belated accounts of gun pncilce by
the naval brigade at Modder River, ■ hich Is
constantly improving. One dispatch describes
the havoc made by a naval gun which ha I found
the range for the main source of the water sup
ply for the Boer camp. \ — -| i
British accounts of Baden-Powell's -sortie
cannot be expected for several days. The Boer
official dispatches stating that two well known
British officers, one of them a son of the Prlma
Minister, were wounded, have caused much
anxiety in the world of wealth and fashion;
Lord Edward Cecil's wife is the daughter of
Admiral Maxse. and Is now in South Africa.
Lord Charles Cavendish-Bentinck, is a ha!,
brother of the Duke of Portland and is art offl,
cer of brilliant promise. A grim story is told of
Lord Salisbury In connection with the service of
his son under Baden-Powell at Mafeking. He

the Boers had retired to Colesberg from their
ir.trenchments at Rensburg. The British cavalry
from Dordrecht had met with a superior force of
the enemy and withdrawn in good order after
a skirmish.
DELAGOA BAY INCIDENTS.
The German press is not favorably Impressed
with the seizure of the liner Bundesratb in
Delagoa Bay. The incident is likely to excite
the anti-British feeling in Germany unless the
Foreign Office takes prompt measures for ex
plaining the action of the Magicienne and show
ing what justification there was for the seizure.
Cape Town dispatches contain evidence of the
effective use which the Boers have made of
Lourenco Marques as a base of military
plies. Armstrong guns have been larded there
recently with ammunition carts and other
stores and stnt to the Transvaal.
A dispatch from Durban states that a letter
has been received from Consul Macrum giving
an account of the British prisoners. This letter
was probably written by the Consul at Lourengo
Marques, as Mr. Macrum lfas been reported as
sailing from Delagoa Bay thirteen days ago.
There is no new light in London upon Mr. Ma
crum's mysterious abandonment of hi? post at
a critical time. The most probable e-xplanation
seems to be the high expense of living in Pre
toria during war time. Mr. Macrum had no pri
vate Income, and his salary was a beggarly one
for South Africa, where the cost of living has
always been excessive. I. N. F.
BRITISH COLONISTS AGAINST DUTCH.
ENOUGH OF THEM, IT IS THOUGHT, TO
POPE WITH THE DISLOYAL ELEMENT.
Cape Town, Dec. 28.— The colonial authorities
are using every precaution to prevent an insur
rection on the part of the disloyal Dutch in
Cape Colony and to suppress a rising if it should
occur. Everywhere the British colonists are be
ing organized into hoir.e guards, drilled, armed
and made ready to act in their respective local
ities should armed Dutch colonists gather.
The theory is that the British home staying
colonials should be fully prepared to cope with
the Dutch colonials •without the aid of regulars.
The alertness of the British makes united ac
tion on the part of pro-Boer residents difficult.
Unable to act ' operly, they slip away singly or
in small groups to join the enemy's forces. The
authorities have been Informed of many centres
of agitation, which it is considered undesirable
to particularize, but there is nothing like con
certed action apparent over wide districts.
The case of Mr. Michan, solicitor to the De
Beers company, who Is accused of treason, ac
quires increased importance, as he has been
transferred from the custody of the civil au
thorities here to the military authorities at De
Aar. His high position causes the Dutch to
watch his case keenly.
Parties of Boers have been operating some
seventy miles south of Lord Methuen's position.
Boers appeared on Christmas Day near the rail
way, about twenty-nine miles south of De Aar.
A force of the Duke of Edinburgh's Own Volun
teers prepared to engage them, but the enemy
retired.
Another party fired into a British patrol camp
during the night of December 27. This was near
Victoria Road. An attempt was made not far
from that point to damage the railway. One
man was caught in the act and shot.
A similar attempt was made between Multler
solel and Klapmuts, but the would-be wreckers
escaped. Like attempts c.re reported from sev
eral other points. Evidently small parties of
Boers or Dutch colonials have been trying to
Interrupt the movement of trains, but thus far
they have been baffled by the elaborate British
patrolling.
In one case a patrol of regulars fired on a
patrol of colonials. The latter were wearing
broad brimmed hats and were mistaken by the
British for Boers. No casualties occurred, but
in consequence of the incident an order has been
issued requiring aJI classes of troops to wear
helmets.
London. Jan. I.— "The Daily Mail" publishes
the following dispatch from Cape Town:
Ninety-five per cent of the Bechuana farmers
in the Vryburg district joined the Boers, helping
them to loot the stores throughout the country
north of Orange River. They also undertook to
invest Mafeking, while General Cronje's men
went south to mpet Lord Methuen. The gov
ernment of Bechaunaland is being administered
just as if the Dutch had been in possession for
ages.
A SKIRMISH NEAR DORDRECHT.
BRITISH CAVALRY FORCED TO RETIRE BY
SUPERIOR NUMBERS.
London, Jan. 1. — The War Office publishes -the
following dispatch, dated yesterday, from the
general officer commanding at Cape Town:
Methuen's position is unchanged.
French reports that the Boers, fearing their
communications would be cut by our cavalry,
have retired to Colesberg.
Hear unofficially from Sterkstroom that a
British reconnoissance seven miles north of
Dordrecht engaged superior forces and was
ob.ip^d to retire on Dordrecht.
Later— Montmorency, on December 30, met su
perior force using artillery, jperated to rear or
80-rs. In course of the day he was compelled to
withdraw to Dordrecht in good order, assisted by
slxtv men sent from Dordrecht, before which we
are "in position for defence. The following caSual

BOERS CUT OFF BT HIGH WATER.
Frere Camp, Natal, Dec. 30.— Owing to the

NEW YORK. MONDAY. JANUARY 1. 1900.-TEX PAGES.
REBEL PLOTTERS FOILED.
AMERICAN VIGILANCE SPOILS A SCHEME
IN MANILA.
BOMBS WERE TO BE THROWN AMONG FOR
EIGN CONSULS AT LAWTON'3 FUNERAL
INSURGENTS IN PAVITE.
Manila, Dec. 31. — Four explosive bomb?, a few
firearms and 500 rounds of ammunition were
discovered in a house in the centre of Manila
thia morning while the police were seeking Re
carte, the insurgent leader, who was said to have
come to Manila in the hope of effecting an out
break yesterday by taking advantage of the
mobiliz&tion of the American troops at General
Lawton's funeral.
To-day v developed that the plot Included
the throwing of bombs among the foreign con
suls attending the ceremony, in order to bring
about International complications. These, it
seems, were to have been thrown from the Es
colta's high buildings, but the avoidance of the
Escolta by the funeral procession spoiled the
plan.
The populace, it is thought, had been pre
pared for the attempt by a rumor, circulated
widely among the natives yesterday, that Agui
naldo was in Manila and would personally lead
the outbreak. The American authorities, hav
ing been advised of what was brewing, prepared
for all contingencies.
Captain Morrison, who commands the troops
in the most turbulent district of the city, says
he does not believe an actual uprising will ever
occur, as the natives lack the resolution to take
the first steps in a movement that would c itall
fighting at close quarters with the American
troops.
An American advance in Cavit4 Province,
south of Manila, is expected shortly. Trust
worthy reports from native spies show that there
are upward of two thousand organized insur
gents under arms within a mile of Imus. They
are strengthening their intrenchments and pos
sess artillery.
At Novaleta the Filipino intrenchments have
been much strengthened since General Schwan's
advance. A thousand of the enemy, are in
that vicinity, and there, are six hundred at San
Francisco de Malabon. From twelve to a hun
dred garrison all the towns in the southern part
of Cavity Province, and the same may be said
of the towns in Batangras Province.
The provinces of North Camarines and South
Camarines hold quantities of hemp which the
people cannot market. As a consequence the
population in that part of Luzon is suffering
from lack of food. Rice now costs- four times
its normal price.
It is estimated that one thousand insurgents
are intrenched at Calamba.
Reports have been received that two thousand
insurgents are massed at Mount Arayat, having
strong positions which command steep and nar
row trails, and that they are prepared to roll
bowlders down upon advancing troops.
Life along the coasts of the provinces of
Cagayan and North and South Ilocos is resum
ing normal conditions. The American troops
occupy the important towns and patrol the
country roads. The natives implore the Ameri
cans to continue the occupation, to establish a
settled government and to determine the un
certainty, abuses and confiscations that have
characterized the rule of Tagalog revolutionists
during the last eighteen months.
Vast amounts of tobacco, estimated tr» v>
worth $2,000,000, are ready for shipment to
Manila. The opening of the ports of Dagupan,
San Fernando, Vigan, Laoag and Aparri to
morrow will permit the resumption of trade,
bringing relief to communities greatly in need
of foodstuffs. Many vessels have already cleared
from Manila for these ports.
Incoming Spanish prisoners declare that Agul
naldo has ordered the release of all Spaniards
now in possession or the rebels. The mountain
passes of Cagayan and the two Ilocos provl"<>«o
are still guarded, in the hor><> °£ catching the in-
Rnreont General Timo, who is still a fugitive.
It is asserted that Lieutenant Gillmore is in
Tinio's custody.
The transport Zaflro has arrived at Manila,
bringing General Tirano, who is much grieved
at being supplanted by Colonel Hood as Military
Governor of Cagayan Province. He hesitates to
land, because he looks upon Manila as a nest of
insurgents, who may assassinate him because
he surrendered Cagayan. He says that when
Colorel Hood arrived the presidents of all the
towns in the province repaired to Aparri and
begged him to continue them in their positions,
saying also that the natives desired to be rid of
the presence of the Macabebes, the friars and
the colored American soldiers, toward whom
they entertained a violent antipathy.

ADMIRAL MONTOJO'S DEFENCE
CAUSES TO WHICH COMMANDER AT MAXILA
ASCRIBES SPANISH DEFEAT.
Chicago, Dec. Sl.— "The Tribune" of to-day prints
the text of Admiral Montojo's defence at the court
martial proceedings for his defeat at Manila. The
bulk of the blame is charged by the Admiral not to
hin-.self or to his fleet, but to the Spanish Govern
ment for its unprepared conditions. He also alleges
that Admiral Dewey kept out of range of the
Spanish guns, a proceeding which Montojo refer* to
as "a retreat." Montojo says:
The only preparation that had been made for war
was made by the Americans, who were business
like, and arranged everything; with pencil and
paper. The initial velocity of our cannon was 510
metres; that of the smallest cannon of our enemies
was 750 metres. Admiral Dewey, with pencil in
hand noted the thickness of his mantlets and his
casements, and knew what energy was required to
penetrate them. He also knew exactly the weight
of the most powerful projectile of our ships, and by
a simple mathematical calculation he arrived at
the distance at which he could fight without him
self receiving any harm. Thus he ascertained that
he could fight at a distance of 2.000 or 3,000 metres
with absolute impunity. The situation, therefore,
was just this: We were vulnerable to all the pro
jectiles of the enemy, and this the enemy well
knew, while he got out of reach of our cannon, and
remained out of reach all the while.
Admiral Montojo adds:
In order to give an idea of our miserable situa
tion I may menticn that we had only fourteen tor
pedoes for the defence of 2.000 metres of space, and
that the cable, which we obtained In Hong- Kong,
•was only long enough for five torpedoes and there
fore only five torpedoes could be placed.

CEREMONIES.
MASSES AXD WATCH NIGHT SERVICES IN TTTB
CHURCHES, HORN BLOWIXO IN THE STREETS
AND FUN MAKING IN MANY CWBS.
This is the day for making good resolutions.
Some young men ir.ay dread the fierce struggle
which It will cost them to "swear off" from drink
and tobacco, and some young women may fear
ttfe physical strain Involved in relinquishing novels
in favor of histories; but let such as these ask
any of the old bends— one who has done those
things time and time again— and they will learn
how easy it is. after all. Old '99 departed much
ns his predecessors did. and young "00 came m
with the usual ceremonies. He waa observed to
blush a little when hailed as "naughty naught."
No doubt it la hard to be dignified under such a
doubtful nickname, and many persons will find
It hard to address their letters properly for a few
days to come. They have become used to writing
•99 and will be likely to begin with the first
nine, then suddenly recollect that we have reached
ninety-ten, bo to speak, hastily substitute an "0"
for the second line they have been accustomed
to for a year, and thus surprise themselves by
dating their letter ten years behind the age. or
1800b instead of 1900. Nevertheless "naughty
naught" was heartily welcomed, and fervent hopes
were expressed that he would not prove aa mis
chievous as he sounds.
DIFFERENT KINDS OF WELCOME.
The form of that welcome took widely diverging
aspects. In St. Patrick's Cathedral midnight mass
was celebrated with impressive ceremony. Mass
was said in other Romrn Catholic churches also,
by special permission of Pope Leo XIII, for the
purpose of ushering in the "Holy Year" with be
fitting solemnity. In many Protestant churches
watchnight services -were held, and the old year
died and the new year was born as the congrega
tions knelt !r. silent prayer. In sharp contrast to
these were the festivities in many a clubhouse and
assembly room, where healths were drunk and
"Happy New Years" were flung about over brim
ming punchbowls and the pipe of goodfellowshlp.
Neither did the lower end of Manhattan Island
escape the annual pandemonium of those who
see much fun of a. rarely clever sort in drowning
the sweet chimes of Old Trinity with the- blare of
flshhorns and that laughter which crackles like
thorns under a. pot.
As early as 10 o'clock these feeble minded chil
dren of a larger growth began to stream down
Broadway on foot and by cable car, some coming
on the elevated roads from as far north as Har
lem. Another stream poured over the Brooklyn
Bridge and marched Into Broadway through Park
Row. Still others came from South Brooklyn and
Staten Island by ferry. Nearly all had long tin
horns, and those who forgot these humorous in
struments had plenty of opportunities to buy them
from pediers, who fomented the noise for their
own profit.
EVEN WOMEN BLEW THEM.
Women were not lacking among the horn blowers,
but more frequently they rested content with sup
plying the admiration which a horn blower expects
and would be vastly surprised if he did not get. To
the credit of the gentler sex, be It said, however,
that most of the women In that packed throng of
windjammers had come to hear the chimes, not to
drown them, and their faces showed disappoint
ment and disapproval of this triumph of blatancy
over harmony.
Following are the airs which the great bells of
Trinity tossed out on the crisp night air over the

SNOW EXPECTED TO-DAY.
So shrewdly cold was the early part of the night
as well as yesterday afternoon that the streets of
the city, the walks and the drives in the parks
looked almost bare In comparison with former New
Year's days when the weather was less severe. The
lowest point which the mercury reached yesterday
was 9 degrees above zero. This was at 6 a, m. It
grew gradually less cold as the day advanced, and
by midnight the mercury had risen to 21 degrees
above zero. At that hour the Weather Bureau
was predicting that the first day of the new year
would be cloudy, with continued cold and probably
a snowstorm, by way of a picturesque beginning.

SHORE.

are feared between Great Britain and France
over the expiration of the Newfoundland fish
eries modus Vivendi to-day.

weeks and the British Parliament is also closed, so

some weeks to remedy the defect. France is thus

DEPUTY COLLECTOR SUSPENDED.
FRESH SENSATION IN HAVANA OVER THE

Havana, Dec. 31. — A sensation was caused in
this city by the suspension from duty of Senor
Arturo Arostegui, Deputy Collector, on account
of the recent frauds by appraisers, through
